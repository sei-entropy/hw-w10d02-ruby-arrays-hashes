6

##### How much of this did you complete? (0-10)
- 10, no bouns.

##### How long did it take?
- 3 h

##### Was there anything that you struggled with?  If so, what?
Yes, I lost a lot of time in debugging with the code, it's throwing error messages even if I am sure that this piece of code is working!
I was planning to solve the bouns as well but I could not handle it any more!
Here are some of the unstoppable error messages that drive me insane.

1) `stop_at_one_station': undefined local variable or method `subway_map_lines' for main:Object (NameError)

After I did a lot of research and debugging my code! it's nothing but to turn the hash into UPPER CASE! really! and still, that's not solving the problem! I got another error message saying the opposite of the above error message!


2) `dynamic constant assignment
        SUBWAY_MAP_LINES = {

and finllay, I tried to change and modify some of my code structure and then I got the resutl!

##### Is there anything that you would like some further information on?
debugging in ruby!
##### Do you have any suggestions to improve this assignment?
n/a
